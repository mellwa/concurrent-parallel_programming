Question 2 
    (a)
	Since we cannot either using global variables or passing extra parameter 
     into our fix-up routine, we have no way to choose the handler that should be
     used on specific condition. In this program, there are two types of handler that
     perform different tasks. Therefore, using fix-up routine in this program 
     cannot simulate performance of _Resume/_CatchResume since the fix-up routine cannot
     determine which handler should be used to specific condition. Thus, this program 
     cannot be simulated by passing handler routines among the routines.

Q1
    There is a lovelock among the sweeping angels.
    The angels can move quickly and silently if there is no other being
observe them, but if they are observed by other beings, they will become
quantum locked.
    We can assume angel 0 will be locked by angel 1 if angel 1 is looking at
angel 0, and since angel 0 is still looking at angel 1, angel 1 is locked by
angel 0. They never can make any progress unless outside force move them
apart. It's just like two people meet in a one-way narrow bridge, and each 
of them try to be polite and give way to the other. So they simultaneously 
step to the same side each time and never make any progress.
